            <hr>
            <!--Description-->
            <p>Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves, characterised by feathers,
                toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart,
                and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in)
                bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) common ostrich.</p>

                        <p>Each feather on a bird's body is a finely tuned structure that serves an important role in
                            the bird's activities. Feathers allow birds to fly, but they also help them show off, blend
                            in, stay warm, and keep dry.</p>

                        <p>A bird beak is the most important resource it has, and every species has one solely designed
                            for survival. Birds use beaks for just about everything: building nests, feeding their
                            young, cleaning their feathers, defending themselves and eating.</p>

                        <p>The skeletons of birds (and other flying vertebrates) need to be lightweight to minimize the
                            metabolic cost of flight, and at the same time strong enough to withstand the forces
                            encountered during flight. The same trade-off applies to manmade airframes.</p>

                        <p>Birds have 4-chambered hearts made of the right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium and left
                            ventricle. The division helps for efficient flow of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Birds
                            also have specific adaptations for flight, including a larger heart relative to body weight
                            and a faster heart rate.</p>

                    collected for clothing and fashion. From the Middle Ages to the 1800s, carrier pidgeons were use for
                    commerce, navigation and especially in the armed forces where they send messages to and fro and even
                    to the enemies.</p>

            <hr>
            <!--Description-->
            <p>Birds are feathered theropod dinosaurs and constitute the only known living dinosaurs. Likewise, birds
                are considered reptiles in the modern cladistic sense of the term, and their closest living relatives
                are the crocodilians. Birds are descendants of the primitive avialans (whose members include
                Archaeopteryx) which first appeared during the Late Jurassic. According to DNA evidence, modern birds
                (Neornithes) evolved in the Early to Late Cretaceous, and diversified dramatically around the time of
                the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 mya, which killed off the pterosaurs and all non-avian
                dinosaurs. Below shows the time period of their evolution.</p>

                        For example: A bird who lived in a colder climate would develop feather to help protect
